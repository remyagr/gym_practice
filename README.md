This repo is for the final project of Artificial Intelligence class.

## How to run

*cartpole-random.py* runs the toy environment of cartpole. *simpleGA.py* is the main file of our project that runs the environment of Bowling (based on its Atari counterpart). It uses a simple Genetic Algorithm to achieve results that are on par with human's, and it's much faster than training in a neural network.
